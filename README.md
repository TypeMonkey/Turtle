# sNEK 
_A statically typed , s-expression based meta language_

`java -jar snek.jar sourceFile.snek`


### Features
_"I just gotta finish this so it looks I actually did something for SD Hacks"_

The main attribute of sNEK is it's barebones simplicity when it comes to many programming languages. 

With only **8** basic expressions, sNEK offers quick application development and important guarentees with its static type checking.

### Requirements
sNEK is written in Java 1.8 and depends on a modified version of Grammatica 1.6 for its grammar and parsing. 

Every binary will be released with Grammatica 1.6 included, so your machine needs to only have Java 8 for sNEK to run.

### Writing in sNEK
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/TypeMonkey/sNEK/wiki/Syntax-of-sNEK) for a quick rundown on the syntax of sNEK.

### Background
_"JavaScript was written in ten days, I'll write sNEK in two."_

I wrote sNEK in a matter of around twelve hours to see how much complexity/features I can put into a language in a short amount of time.

sNEK is largely based off a continuing programming assignment in class I'm currently taking called [CSE131](https://ucsd-cse131-f19.github.io/) which is taught by [Professor Joe Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io/).

Though I have experience with programming language construction, both the content and Professor Politz have offered much needed insight into this weirdly attractive field. It has been both a painful, yet rewarding, experience so far and I'm excited to see what else this class has to offer.

**Note:** sNEK is not a sponsored project by the staff of CSE 131. This is merely an independent project developed by a student of CSE 131 on their own time, without prior knowledge or communication with the staff of CSE 131. If you have any questions or concerns regarding sNEK, please [contact](jguaro@ucsd.edu) the creator directly.

### Credits and Thanks
This wouldn't have been possible without CSE 131,  Professor Politz and his TAs. 

Lastly, I'd like to thank the Bob Nystrom and his online book [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) for kickstarting my many PL projects.
